# Welcome to "Prepare Me for Drupal" repository. :wave:

This reprository acts as a question bank for preparation for Drupal Certification - Frontend, Backend & Developer Certification.

## PLEASE NOTE (Important to read) :double_exclamation_mark:
- The sole purpose of this document is to help the candidate prepare for the drupal certification exam.
- Please do not consider this document as a "leaked" version of Drupal certification exam, the questions framed here are based upon the following:
   - The drupal development experience of the contributors.
   - Experience of taking/attempting the Drupal certification quiz.
- Hence, any resemblance to quiz questions is a mere coincidence.

## Intention behind creating this repository...

- The sole intention behind creating this repository is to help Drupalers prepare for Drupal certification exams. In addition to the Drupal Docs (which is the best resource for preparing for and learning Drupal), Drupalize.me and other resources mentioned in this section, this document gives you a glimpse of what kind of questions should we expect when it comes to Drupal Certifications.

- After reading the point mentioned above, if you still have questions in mind like - "Ok! got it! But still WHY? Is Drupal Documentation not enough?", then to explain this further - This repository is the result of a conversation I had with young Drupalers who wanted to appear for certification exam but were not sure how to prepare for it. They had questions in mind like -

  - What is the right time to appear for these exams?
  - What is the difficulty level?
  - The right way to prepare for it? or How to clear these exams? --> Major area of concern.
  - What is in it for me? How is this certification going to help me?

I've tried to answer all of these in this section.
