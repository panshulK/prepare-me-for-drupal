## PLEASE NOTE (Important to read) :triangular_flag_on_post:
- The sole purpose of this document is to help the candidate prepare for the drupal certification exam.

   - The drupal development experience of the contributors.
   - Experience of taking/attempting the Drupal certification quiz.
- Hence, any resemblance to quiz questions is a mere coincidence.

#### Don't feel like wasting anymore time? Straight away jump to :point_right: [QUESTION BANK](docs/QUESTIONS.md).

## Intention behind creating this repository...

- The sole intention behind creating this repository is to help Drupalers prepare for Drupal certification exams. In addition to the Drupal Docs (which is the best resource for preparing for and learning Drupal), Drupalize.me and other resources mentioned in this [section](#drupal-study-material--related-resources), this document gives you a glimpse of what kind of questions should we expect when it comes to Drupal Certifications.

- After reading the point mentioned above, if you still have questions in mind like - __"*Ok! got it! But still WHY*?__ Is Drupal Documentation not enough?", then to explain this further - This repository is the result of a conversation I had with young Drupalers who wanted to appear for certification exam but were not sure how to prepare for it. They had questions in mind like -

  - What is the right time to appear for these exams?
  - What is the difficulty level?
  - The right way to prepare for it? or How to clear these exams? --> Major area of concern.
  - What is in it for me? How is this certification going to help me?

I've tried to answer all of these in this [section](#lets-get-some-clarity-around-this-certification).

## [Author's](https://panshulkhurana.com) Drupal Certification Quiz Experience...

I've shared my experience in the form of a blog on my Portfolio website. Here's the link - https://www.panshulkhurana.com/post/thoughts-on-acquia-certified-frontend-specialist-drupal-exam

## Let's get some clarity around this Certification...

### What is the right time to appear for these exams?

IMO the right time to appear for the Drupal Certification exams (Frontend, Backend & Devegloper) is -

- When you have the experience of extensive development on at least 3-4 Drupal projects.
- During this period, you have had the opportunity to -

  - :white_check_mark: Develop features(big or small)
  - :white_check_mark: Fix bugs
  - :white_check_mark: Written & executed test cases
  - :white_check_mark: Work on performance improvement tasks
  - :white_check_mark: Create several custom modules responsible for handling custom CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) operations.

- Experience is the key here, the biggest reason for this is the type of questions we face in these certification exams, the questions are based upon a certain use case or the application of the concept.

- In addition to the experience, how you prepare is going to help you score better in these exams. I believe in hard work and TBH i worked really hard for these exams. If you read my experience [here](#authors-drupal-certification-quiz-experience) then you've probably figured out my strategy - It is purely "Hard Work!!". Once again, I have mentioned all the resources I used in this [section](#authors-drupal-certification-quiz-experience).

### What is the difficulty level?

- The difficulty levels of each of the exams are mentioned in the :arrow_forward: [Exam Specific Question Bank Documentation](docs/QUESTIONS.md). :arrow_backward:

### The right way to prepare for it? or How to clear these exams? (Major area of concern) :bell:

- READ THE [DRUPAL DOCUMENTATION](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop). Trust me, this is the best resource to clear Drupal certification exam. :star:

- Revisit all the work you've done in Drupal so far -
   - Custom development.
   - Site building.
   - Site designing.
   - Template creation.
   - Performance Management or Improvement
   - Writing a Secure Drupal code.

 - Also, make sure that you understand the differences between the different versions of Drupal, majorly Drupal 7 & Drupal 8.

 - In addition to the Drupal version differences, keep yourself updated with the information on code deprecation. Ofcourse, it is difficult to remember all deprecations but revisit & remember some of the major ones.

- Atlast, refer our __*Question Bank*__, this is specially curated to help you prepare well for these exams. We keep them updated! :grinning:

### What is in it for me? How is this certification going to help me?

-Some people may argue that Certifications aren't really helpful! It is just the way of "getting noticed".
While I cannot deny this fact but I also don't agree with it.

> *Certifications can help you build a strong conceptual base regardless of the technology it covers.*

It totally depends upon how you use this opportunity.

Coming back to question - __"*How can Drupal Certification help me get better in what I do?*"__, IMO these exams, they test your knowledge by asking the questions based on a use case (a scenario you may come across while working on a Drupal project) or the application of the concept. Sometimes, you may feel that all the options mentioned in the question are correct but the real struggle is to find the most appropriate option. That's the correct answer! This is a good way of measuring how far you've come & what is it that you still have to do to get better, when it comes to Drupal Development.

These exams have helped me evaluate & focus on my weak areas and I've improved significantly as a Drupal Developer.

BTW, I've talked about Certifications in general in detail in my blog here - https://www.panshulkhurana.com/post/are-certifications-worth-it
